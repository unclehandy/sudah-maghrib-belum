# Django Boilerplate with Tailwind CSS

This is a Django boilerplate project designed to help you quickly get started with modern web development. It includes a set of essential packages for building and maintaining clean, organized, and efficient Django applications. Additionally, it integrates **Tailwind CSS** (installed via npm) for rapid front-end development.

## 📦 Included Packages

The following Python packages are pre-installed (as listed in `requirements.txt`):

- **asgiref**: Provides ASGI support for asynchronous Django applications.
- **black**: An opinionated code formatter to keep your code clean and consistent.
- **click**: A simple and powerful command-line interface creation library.
- **Django**: The core web framework — version 5.1.7.
- **isort**: Automatically sorts imports to keep your code organized.
- **mypy-extensions**: Additional features for static type checking with MyPy.
- **packaging**: Utilities for dealing with Python package versions.
- **pathspec**: Used to define file patterns (e.g., for ignoring files).
- **platformdirs**: Manages platform-specific directories for storing app data.

Additionally, **Tailwind CSS** is installed via npm to simplify styling and provide utility-first CSS classes out of the box.
